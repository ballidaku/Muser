 <p>The "session" portion of our app is completely optional yet highly recommended for those who are serious about their fitness.</p>
 <p>This section grants user's UNLIMITED access to a selected trainers, personalized exercise videos, each video ranges from 15- 30 min , providing in-depth details on how to perform certain routines, an array of workouts, demo's correct posture, tips and tricks, how to's, and much more .

There is a monthly fee, of $5, per each member a user decides to train with..</p>
 <p>For the protection of our trainers work, there will be no refunds provided, after 10 minutes.</p>
 <h4>How do trainers earn a spot in the Most recommended section?</h4>
 <p>In a community this big it can become overwhelming when searching for the perfect trainer. So why not turn to our user's, the one's who are actually enrolled in these sessions, To simplify this process for others. The "Most Recommended" section uses a unique algorithm (based off of likes and recommendation) in order to determine which trainers are best fit in a certain category. So, remember to recommend and like your trainers video's!</p>
 <h4>How does MUSER work?</h4>
 <p>  Similar to other social network's, MUSER  allows trainers to build a personal profile which they may utilize to promote their work, by sharing  images and 15sec  video's with the community. Trainers are also given a private portal called "sessions", where they can post 10 -30 min personalized videos, workout routines, tips & tricks, How to's, etc. For every follower that subscribes to your sessions (the 30 min video's ) you are paid $3. This is a monthly reoccurring income,  as long as you maintain your  subscriber base,  you continue to make revenue.</p>
 <p>MUSER believes in individuality therefore we don't require any particular structure to be followed, we simply ask for a minimum of 3 sessions per week.</p>
 <h4>How am I Paid out?</h4>
 <p>There's an integrated  "wallet section" which illustrates your total client base, cancelled clients, and total earning. The amount reflected on your account upon or closing period (the 28th of every month) is what will be disbursed to you on pay day (every 30th of the month).  This amount will vary on a month to month basis based on your subscriptions.</p>
 <p><b>NOTE:</b> For the protection of your work, there's a 10 min cancellation policy. After 10 minutes users are no longer allowed to cancel their subscription, for the month at hand. unless the minimum  expectation of 3 session's per week hasn't been met.</p>
